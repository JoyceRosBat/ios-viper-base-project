# ios-viper-base-project

This is an iOS base project that uses Swift and VIPER architecture.

In this project we have a root base view and all the necesary to start programming an app with VIPER architecture.

Also I have prepared the app with some features for Network and UserDefaults.

I also prepare the app to use Cocoapods and the Podfile is prepared to install the Kingfisher library (https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher).
